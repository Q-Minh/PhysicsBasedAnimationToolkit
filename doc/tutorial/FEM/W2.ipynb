Notice that $u^t$ must be discretized at FEM nodes, since it is to be projected (in the Galerkin sense) via the mass matrix $M$. Thus, pick a subset of FEM nodes, and initialize their heat values to $1$ (or something else). Set the initial heat values of other nodes to $0$ (or something else). \n",
