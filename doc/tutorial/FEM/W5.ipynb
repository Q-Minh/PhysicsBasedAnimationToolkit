    "We now turn to deriving shape functions for different elements, the fundamental building block for FEM discretization. In particular, we focus on the Lagrange elements. Instead of deriving shape functions by hand, we will systematically solve for these shape functions using the interpolation problem described [here](./README.md) in the subsection on shape functions. To do so, we will use a symbolic calculator, [sympy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html)."
