## Overview

> _We recommend exploring the official [CMake documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/) to beginner CMake users, if they wish to build this project from source_.

The Physics Based Animation Toolkit (PBAT) is a (mostly templated) cross-platform C++20 library of algorithms and data structures commonly used in computer graphics research on physically-based simulation in dimensions `1,2,3`. For most use cases, we recommend using our library via its Python interface, enabling seamless integration into Python's ecosystem of powerful scientific computing packages.

## Quick start

> _We recommend downloading the [Tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) profiler server to analyze execution of PBAT algorithms, available as [precompiled executable](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy/releases). PBAT currently supports [Tracy 0.10](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy/releases/tag/v0.10)._

### C++

Take a look at the unit tests, found in the library's source (`.cpp` or `.cu`) files.

### Python

To download and install from PyPI, run in command line
```bash
pip install pbatoolkit
```
or, alternatively
```bash
pip install pbatoolkit-gpu
```
if your environment is [properly setup to use our GPU algorithms](#cuda).

Verify [`pbatoolkit`](https://pypi.org/project/pbatoolkit/)'s contents in a Python shell

```python
import pbatoolkit as pbat
help(pbat.fem)
help(pbat.geometry)
help(pbat.profiling)
help(pbat.math)
help(pbat.gpu)
```

A bunch of Python scripts demonstrating usage of [`pbatoolkit`](https://pypi.org/project/pbatoolkit/) can be found in the [examples folder](python/examples/), along with their associated [`requirements.txt`](python/examples/requirements.txt)  for easily downloading necessary dependencies via `pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt`. Their command line interface follows the pattern
```bash
python[.exe] path/to/examples/[example].py -i path/to/input/mesh
```
The full interface is always revealed by `-h` or `--help`, i.e. 
```bash
python[.exe] path/to/examples/[example].py -h
```

> _The examples assume the user provides the meshes to [`pbatoolkit`](https://pypi.org/project/pbatoolkit/). Triangle (surface) meshes can easily be obtained via [Thingi10K](https://ten-thousand-models.appspot.com/), [TurboSquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/Search/3D-Models/free) or authored yourself in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). Tools like [TetWild](https://github.com/Yixin-Hu/TetWild), [fTetWild](https://github.com/wildmeshing/fTetWild) and [TetGen](https://wias-berlin.de/software/index.jsp?id=TetGen&lang=1) can then convert them into tetrahedral (volume) meshes. We provide [helper scripts](python/tools/mesh/) to facilitate mesh processing and their associated [`requirements.txt`](python/tools/mesh/requirements.txt)._

Example results are showcased in our [Gallery](#gallery).

### Tutorial

Head over to our hands-on [tutorials section](./doc/tutorial/) to learn more about physics based animation in both theory and practice!

## Dependencies

See [`vcpkg.json`](./vcpkg.json) for a versioned list of our dependencies, available via [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).

> Use of [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) is not mandatory, as long as dependencies have compatible versions and are discoverable by CMake's [`find_package`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html) mechanism.

### CUDA

#### PyPI

[`pbatoolkit-gpu`](https://pypi.org/project/pbatoolkit-gpu/) (downloaded from PyPI) requires dynamically linking to an instance of the
- [CUDA 12 Runtime library](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#cuda-runtime), and your
- [CUDA Driver](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/#driver-api). 

> Recall that the CUDA Runtime is [ABI compatible](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/archive/12.5.1/cuda-driver-api/version-mixing-rules.html) up to major version.

On 64-bit Windows, these are `cudart64_12.dll` and `nvcuda.dll`. Ensure that they are discoverable via Windows' [DLL search order](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order). We recommend adding `<drive>:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.<minor>\bin` (i.e. the binary folder of your CUDA Toolkit installation) to the `PATH` environment variable. The driver should already be on the search path by default after installation.

On Linux, they are `libcudart.so.12` and `libcuda.so.1`. Ensure that they are discoverable via Linux's [dynamic linker/loader](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html). If they are not already in a default search path, we recommend simply updating the library search path, i.e. `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="path/to/driver/folder;path/to/runtime/folder;$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"`.

> MacOS does not support CUDA GPUs.

Our [`pbatoolkit-gpu`](https://pypi.org/project/pbatoolkit/) prebuilt binaries include [PTX](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-compiler-driver-nvcc/#virtual-architectures), such that program load times will be delayed by [JIT](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#just-in-time-compilation) compilation on first use. [Verify](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) that your NVIDIA GPU supports [compute capability](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#compute-capabilities) at least 7.0. For example, only RTX 2060 up to 4090 chips are supported in the GeForce series. Runtime GPU performance may be constrained by the targeted compute capability.

#### Local

Consider [locally building and installing](#build--install) `pbatoolkit` against your native GPU for the following reasons.
- Achieve optimal GPU performance for your platform.
- Support older/newer GPUs and CUDA Toolkit versions.

## Configuration

| `PBAT_USE_SUITESPARSE`       | `ON,OFF` | `OFF`   | Link to user-provided [SuiteSparse](https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse) installation via CMake's [`find_package`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html). |
| `PBAT_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`     | `ON,OFF` | `OFF`   | Build project's library targets as shared/dynamic. |

Either run CMake's configure step manually
```bash
cmake -S <path/to/PhysicsBasedAnimationToolkit> -B <path/to/build> -D<option>=<value> ...
```
or, alternatively (and preferably)
```bash
cmake --preset=<my-favorite-user-preset>
```

Our project provides [configuration presets](./CMakePresets.json) that capture typical use configurations. For the best experience, install [`vcpkg`](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) and set `VCPKG_ROOT=path/to/vcpkg` as an environment variable. Then, you can select one of our available presets, for example `cmake --preset=default`. Refer to the [CMake presets documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html) for more information.

## Build & Install

### C++

Build and install transparently across platforms using the [cmake build CLI](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#build-a-project) and [cmake install CLI](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/Installing%20and%20Testing.html), respectively.

Our CMake project exposes the following build targets
| Target | Description |
|---|---|
| `PhysicsBasedAnimationToolkit_PhysicsBasedAnimationToolkit` | The PBA Toolkit library. |
| `PhysicsBasedAnimationToolkit_Tests` | The test executable, using [doctest](https://github.com/doctest/doctest). |
| `PhysicsBasedAnimationToolkit_Python` | PBAT's Python extension module, using [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11). |

For example, to build tests, run
```bash
cmake --build <path/to/build/folder> --target PhysicsBasedAnimationToolkit_Tests --config Release
```

To install *PhysicsBasedAnimationToolkit* locally, run
```bash
cd path/to/PhysicsBasedAnimationToolkit
cmake -S . -B build -D<option>=<value> ...
cmake --install build --config Release
```

### Python

For a local installation, which builds from source, our Python bindings build relies on [Scikit-build-core](https://scikit-build-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), which relies on CMake's [`install`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/install.html) mechanism. As such, you can configure the installation as you typically would when using the CMake CLI directly, by now passing the corresponding CMake arguments in `pip`'s `config-settings` parameter (refer to the [Scikit-build-core](https://scikit-build-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) documentation for the relevant parameters). See our [pyinstall workflow](.github/workflows/pyinstall.yml) for working examples of building from source on Linux, MacOS and Windows. Then, assuming that external dependencies are found via CMake's [`find_package`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html), you can build and install our Python package [`pbatoolkit`](https://pypi.org/project/pbatoolkit/) locally and get the most up to date features. 

> Consider using a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for this step.

As an example, assuming use of [`vcpkg`](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) for external dependency management with `VCPKG_ROOT=path/to/vcpkg` set as an environment variable, run

```bash
pip install . --config-settings=cmake.args="--preset=pip-cuda" -v
```

on the command line to build [`pbatoolkit`](https://pypi.org/project/pbatoolkit/) from source with GPU algorithms included. Additional environment variables (i.e. [`CUDA_PATH`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindCUDAToolkit.html)) and/or CMake variables (i.e. [`CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_LANG_COMPILER.html#variable:CMAKE_%3CLANG%3E_COMPILER)) may be required to be set in order for CMake to correctly discover and compile against your targeted local CUDA installation. Refer to [the CMake documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindCUDAToolkit.html) for more details.

## Gallery

Below, we show a few examples of what can be done in just a few lines of code using [`pbatoolkit`](https://pypi.org/project/pbatoolkit/) and Python. Code can be found [here](./python/examples/).

##### Real-time hyper elasticity dynamics

Our GPU implementation of the eXtended Position Based Dynamics (XPBD) algorithm simulates a ~324k element FEM elastic mesh interactively with contact.

</p>

##### Inter-penetration free elastodynamic contact

Combining [`pbatoolkit`](https://pypi.org/project/pbatoolkit/)'s FEM+elasticity features and the [`IPC Toolkit`](https://ipctk.xyz/) results in guaranteed inter-penetration free contact dynamics between deformable bodies.

</p>

##### Modal analysis

The hyper elastic beam's representative deformation modes, i.e. its low frequency eigen vectors,
are animated as time continuous signals.

</p>

##### GPU broad phase collision detection

Real-time collision detection between 2 large scale meshes (~324k tetrahedra) is accelerated by highly parallel implementations of the [sweep and prune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_and_prune) algorithm, or [linear bounding volume hierarchies](https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/pubs/2012-06_Maximizing-Parallelism-in/karras2012hpg_paper.pdf).

</p>

##### Harmonic interpolation

A smooth (harmonic) function is constructed on [Entei](<https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Entei_(Pok%C3%A9mon)>), required to evaluate to `1` on its paws, and `0` at the top of its tail, using piece-wise linear (left) and quadratic (right) shape functions. Its isolines are displayed as black curves.

</p>

##### Heat method for geodesic distance computation

Approximate geodesic distances are computed from the top center vertex of [Metagross](<https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Metagross_(Pok%C3%A9mon)>) by diffusing heat from it (left), and recovering a function whose gradient matches the normalized heat's negative gradient. Its isolines are displayed as black curves.
