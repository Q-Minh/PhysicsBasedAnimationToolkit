## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Topics

### Dependencies

See [`vcpkg.json`](./vcpkg.json) for a complete list of external dependencies. We recommend using [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) for dependency management, though any dependency discoverable by CMake's [`find_package`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html) will work.

### CUDA Setup

#### For PyPI Installation

[`pbatoolkit-gpu`](https://pypi.org/project/pbatoolkit-gpu/) (downloaded from PyPI) requires dynamically linking to an instance of the
- [CUDA 12 Runtime library](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#cuda-runtime), and your
- [CUDA Driver](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/#driver-api). 

> Recall that the CUDA Runtime is [ABI compatible](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/archive/12.5.1/cuda-driver-api/version-mixing-rules.html) up to major version.

On 64-bit Windows, these are `cudart64_12.dll` and `nvcuda.dll`. Ensure that they are discoverable via Windows' [DLL search order](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order). We recommend adding `<drive>:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.<minor>\bin` (i.e. the binary folder of your CUDA Toolkit installation) to the `PATH` environment variable. The driver should already be on the search path by default after installation.

On Linux, they are `libcudart.so.12` and `libcuda.so.1`. Ensure that they are discoverable via Linux's [dynamic linker/loader](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html). If they are not already in a default search path, we recommend simply updating the library search path, i.e. `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="path/to/driver/folder;path/to/runtime/folder;$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"`.

> MacOS does not support CUDA GPUs.

Our [`pbatoolkit-gpu`](https://pypi.org/project/pbatoolkit/) prebuilt binaries include [PTX](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-compiler-driver-nvcc/#virtual-architectures), such that program load times will be delayed by [JIT](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#just-in-time-compilation) compilation on first use. [Verify](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) that your NVIDIA GPU supports [compute capability](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#compute-capabilities) at least 7.0. For example, only RTX 2060 up to 4090 chips are supported in the GeForce series. Runtime GPU performance may be constrained by the targeted compute capability.

#### Local

> üí° **Pro Tip**: Familiarize yourself with the [CMake documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/) before building from source, especially if you're new to CMake!

Consider [locally building and installing](#build--install) `pbatoolkit` against your native GPU for the following reasons.
- Achieve optimal GPU performance for your platform.
- Support older/newer GPUs and CUDA Toolkit versions.

## Configuration

| Option                       | Values   | Default | Description |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `PBAT_BUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS` | `ON,OFF` | `OFF`   | Enable `PhysicsBasedAnimationToolkit_PhysicsBasedAnimationToolkit` Python bindings. Generates the CMake target `PhysicsBasedAnimationToolkit_Python`, an extension module for Python, built by this project. |
| `PBAT_BUILD_TESTS`           | `ON,OFF` | `OFF`   | Enable `PhysicsBasedAnimationToolkit_PhysicsBasedAnimationToolkit` unit tests. Generates the CMake target executable `PhysicsBasedAnimationToolkit_Tests`, built by this project. |
| `PBAT_ENABLE_PROFILER`       | `ON,OFF` | `OFF`   | Enable [`Tracy`](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) instrumentation profiling in built `PhysicsBasedAnimationToolkit_PhysicsBasedAnimationToolkit`. |
| `PBAT_PROFILE_ON_DEMAND`     | `ON,OFF` | `OFF`   | Activate Tracy's on-demand profiling when `PBAT_ENABLE_PROFILER` is `ON`. |
| `PBAT_USE_SUITESPARSE`       | `ON,OFF` | `OFF`   | Link to user-provided [SuiteSparse](https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse) installation via CMake's [`find_package`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html). |
| `PBAT_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`     | `ON,OFF` | `OFF`   | Build project's library targets as shared/dynamic. |

| `PBAT_BUILD_DOC`     | `ON,OFF` | `OFF`   | Build project's doxygen documentation. |

Our project provides [configuration presets](./CMakePresets.json) that capture typical use configurations. For the best experience, install [`vcpkg`](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) and set `VCPKG_ROOT=path/to/vcpkg` as an environment variable. Then, you can select one of our available presets, for example `cmake --preset=default`. Refer to the [CMake presets documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html) for more information.

## Build & Install

### C++

Refer to the corresponding CMake [build](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#build-a-project) and [install](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#install-a-project) workflows. We recommend writing a customized [`CMakeUserPresets.json`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html#introduction) for your development environment.

| Target | Description |
|---|---|
| `PhysicsBasedAnimationToolkit_PhysicsBasedAnimationToolkit` | The PBA Toolkit library. |
| `PhysicsBasedAnimationToolkit_Tests` | The test executable, using [doctest](https://github.com/doctest/doctest). |
| `PhysicsBasedAnimationToolkit_Python` | PBAT's Python extension module, using [nanobind](https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind). |
| `PhysicsBasedAnimationToolkit_Docs` | Documentation. |

### Python

For a local installation, which builds from source, our Python bindings build relies on [scikit-build-core](https://scikit-build-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), which in turn relies on CMake's [`install`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/install.html) mechanism. As such, you can configure the installation as you typically would when using the CMake CLI directly, by now passing the corresponding CMake arguments in `pip`'s `config-settings` parameter (refer to the [scikit-build-core](https://scikit-build-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) documentation for the relevant parameters). See our [pyinstall workflow](.github/workflows/pyinstall.yml) for working examples of building from source on Linux, MacOS and Windows. Then, assuming that external dependencies are found via CMake's [`find_package`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html), you can build and install our Python package [`pbatoolkit`](https://pypi.org/project/pbatoolkit/) locally and get the most up to date features. 

> üí° **Pro Tip**: Consider using a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for this step.

As an example, assuming use of [`vcpkg`](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) for external dependency management with `VCPKG_ROOT=path/to/vcpkg` set as an environment variable, run

```bash
pip install . --config-settings=cmake.args="--preset=pip-cuda" -v
```

on the command line to build [`pbatoolkit`](https://pypi.org/project/pbatoolkit/) from source with GPU algorithms included. Additional environment variables (i.e. [`CUDA_PATH`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindCUDAToolkit.html)) and/or CMake variables (i.e. [`CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_LANG_COMPILER.html#variable:CMAKE_%3CLANG%3E_COMPILER)) may be required to be set in order for CMake to correctly discover and compile against your targeted local CUDA installation. Refer to [the CMake documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindCUDAToolkit.html) for more details.

## üé® Gallery

See PBAT in action! These examples showcase what's possible with just a few lines of code. Full source code available in [`python/examples/`](./python/examples/).

##### Real-time hyper elasticity dynamics

Our GPU implementation of the eXtended Position Based Dynamics (XPBD) algorithm simulates a ~324k element FEM elastic mesh interactively with contact.

    <img src="doc/img/gpu.xpbd.bvh.gif" width="250" alt="A 162k element armadillo mesh is dropped on top of another duplicate, but fixed, armadillo mesh on the bottom." />
</p>

##### Inter-penetration free elastodynamic contact

Combining [`pbatoolkit`](https://pypi.org/project/pbatoolkit/)'s FEM+elasticity features and the [`IPC Toolkit`](https://ipctk.xyz/) results in guaranteed inter-penetration free contact dynamics between deformable bodies.

</p>

##### Modal analysis

The hyper elastic beam's representative deformation modes, i.e. its low frequency eigen vectors,
are animated as time continuous signals.

</p>

##### GPU broad phase collision detection

Real-time collision detection between 2 large scale meshes (~324k tetrahedra) is accelerated by highly parallel implementations of the [sweep and prune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_and_prune) algorithm, or [linear bounding volume hierarchies](https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/pubs/2012-06_Maximizing-Parallelism-in/karras2012hpg_paper.pdf).

</p>

##### Harmonic interpolation

A smooth (harmonic) function is constructed on [Entei](<https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Entei_(Pok%C3%A9mon)>), required to evaluate to `1` on its paws, and `0` at the top of its tail, using piece-wise linear (left) and quadratic (right) shape functions. Its isolines are displayed as black curves.

  <img src="doc/img/entei.harmonic.interpolation.order.2.png" width="250" alt="Harmonic interpolation on Entei model using quadratic shape functions" /> 
</p>

##### Heat method for geodesic distance computation

Approximate geodesic distances are computed from the top center vertex of [Metagross](<https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Metagross_(Pok%C3%A9mon)>) by diffusing heat from it (left), and recovering a function whose gradient matches the normalized heat's negative gradient. Its isolines are displayed as black curves.

##### Mesh smoothing via diffusion

Fine details of Godzilla's skin are smoothed out by diffusing `x,y,z` coordinates in time.

<p float="left">
    <img src="doc/img/godzilla.diffusion.smoothing.gif" width="250" alt="Godzilla model with fine details being smoothed out via diffusion" />
</p>

##### Profiling statistics

Computation details are gathered when using [`pbatoolkit`](https://pypi.org/project/pbatoolkit/) and consulted in the [Tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) profiling server GUI.
