    "# Workshop 3: Harmonic solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "Workshop 2 showed that the heat/diffusion equation could be used on general functions (i.e. heat or positions) to smooth them. As the solution evolved in time, it would get smoother and smoother. In fact, one might wonder what happens at the \"end\" of such a diffusion, i.e. the steady state? In this setting, the time derivative of the function would vanish, i.e. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = 0$, since $u$ does not change in the steady state. This leads to the [harmonic (or Laplace) equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_equation) $\\Delta u = 0$. Functions which satisfy this equation are said to be harmonic. In general, harmonic functions are quite smooth, and we can thus often \"enforce\" smoothness on desired solutions by making them harmonic. This smoothness is even more obvious when we consider how harmonic functions are minimizers of the [Dirichlet (or smoothness) energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_energy)\n",

    "2. Consider the vector-valued function of displacements from FEM nodal positions as a minimizer to the Dirichlet energy. In other words, we wish to find some smooth displacement field that takes FEM node positions to some smoother positional configuration. Constrain some region of the FEM mesh to be fixed. Constrain another region of the FEM mesh to \"move\" someplace else, by setting the corresponding Dirichlet conditions in $X,Y,Z$ dimensions to have a non-trivial displacement $[d_X, d_Y, d_Z]$. Solve for the $3$ resulting interpolants and visualize the result.
