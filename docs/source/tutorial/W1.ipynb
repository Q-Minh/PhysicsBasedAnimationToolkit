    "\n",
    "This first workshop on FEM aims to help the reader:\n",
    "- explore/analyze FEM quantities/operators\n",

    "\n",
    "Start by installing the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` on the command line. FEM relies on having meshed geometries at hand, hence we recommend finding clean surface mesh geometry and then using our [mesh processing scripts](https://github.com/Q-Minh/PhysicsBasedAnimationToolkit/tree/master/python/tools/mesh) to tetrahedralize them, if you don't already have access to meshes. You can download surface meshes on [Thingi10K](https://ten-thousand-models.appspot.com/), [TurboSquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/) or other.\n",

    "## Constructing FEM meshes\n",
    "\n",
    "From the input mesh geometry, construct an FEM mesh (i.e. `pbatoolkit.fem.Mesh`) using `pbatoolkit`. Start by exploring the API of the FEM module of `pbatoolkit`. Then, try constructing meshes of different shape function orders on either of line, triangle, and/or tetrahedral meshes. You can do the same for regular geometry (rectangles and boxes) if you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pbatoolkit` expects input matrix data in column major storage (i.e. `order='F'` in [numpy](https://numpy.org/)) and uses double precision floating point numbers as scalars, and 64-bit signed integers as indices. Vertex positions are generally packed in matrix columns, and similarly for cell indices. This format is generally compatible with other packages' APIs, using a no-copy transpose operation (i.e. a row-major `order='C'` matrix with vertex positions in rows has the same memory layout as a column-major `order='F'` matrix with vertex positions in columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Python's `help` command on `pbatoolkit`'s mesh instance, and check that you can access its nodes' positions, its elements' nodal indices, its dimensionality, element type, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that the FEM mesh and the geometric mesh do NOT share the same element indices. Both the FEM and geometric mesh have the same number of elements, and they are ordered in exactly the same way, but the geometric mesh's array of vertex positions does not necessarily correspond to the FEM mesh's array of node positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep an eye on how the number of FEM nodes changes when the mesh's shape function order changes, and the computational cost of constructing higher order meshes. Visualize the FEM mesh's nodes on top of the geometric mesh using `polyscope`."

    "## Higher order FEM\n",
    "\n",
    "When using higher-order FEM, it is often useful to visualize our discretized functions on refined versions of our input geometric mesh. This is due to the fact that renderers that support scalar field visualization use linear interpolation to fill the colors between mesh vertices, so we need to use \"visual\" meshes of higher resolution than our \"geometric\" mesh to see any difference.\n",

Then, in code, use `pbat.geometry.bvh` to compute a spatial query acceleration data structure, our bounding volume implementation (BVH), on the \"geometric\" mesh. Vertices of the \"visual\" mesh should be mapped to the \"computational\" mesh (i.e. the FEM mesh) by \n",
