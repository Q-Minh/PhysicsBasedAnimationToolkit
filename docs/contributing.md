## Coding Style

A `.clang-format` description file is provided in the repository root which should be used to enforce a uniform coding style throughout the code base using the [clang-format tool](https://releases.llvm.org/12.0.0/tools/clang/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html). Recent versions of Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio should come bundled with a `clang-format` installation. On Unix-like systems, `clang-format` can be installed using your favorite package manager.
