# Quick Start

> _We recommend downloading the [Tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) profiler server to analyze execution of PBAT algorithms, available as [precompiled executable](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy/releases). PBAT currently supports [Tracy 0.10](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy/releases/tag/v0.10)._

## C++

Take a look at the unit tests, found in the library's source (`.cpp` or `.cu`) files.

## Python

To download and install from PyPI, run in command line
```bash
pip install pbatoolkit
```
