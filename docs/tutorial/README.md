# Tutorial

We compile a set of tutorials/workshops on various topics related to physics based animation (PBA), which serve the following purposes:
- Act as a persistent, accessible and hands-on learning resource for anyone interested in PBA and related topics.
- Document use cases and usage patterns of our Physics Based Animation Toolkit (PBAT).
- Ease the development of baseline algorithms upon which one could build on for research.

These tutorials are categorized in the following relevant topics:
- [Contact Simulation](./Contact/README.md)
- [Elasticity](./Elasticity/README.md)
- [Finite Element Method](./FEM/README.md)
- [Geometry](./Geometry/README.md)
- [Numerical Algorithms](./Numerics/README.md)
- [Optimization](./Optimization/README.md)
- [Reduced Order Modeling](./ROM/README.md)

The reader will find that much of the content in different categories may overlap. This is unsurprising/inevitable, but hopefully, the content's categorization is not too confusing. Additional topics may also be added in the future (think fluid simulation, differentiable physics, shells, etc.) and reshuffling of the categories will be possible. There is no particular prescribed order in which to consult these tutorials, but some content may have prerequisites that will hopefully be explicitly stated.
