Our discrete heat equation is now an initial value problem [IVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_value_problem#:~:text=In%20multivariable%20calculus%2C%20an%20initial,given%20point%20in%20the%20domain.), such that the initial condition $u(t=0) = u^0$ must be given. Notice that $u^t$ must be discretized at FEM nodes, since it is to be projected (in the Galerkin sense) via the mass matrix $M$. Thus, pick a subset of FEM nodes, and initialize their heat values to $1$ (or something else). Set the initial heat values of other nodes to $0$ (or something else). You can use the function `pbatoolkit.geometry.aabb` to aid in selecting FEM nodes in box regions, or select them manually in `polyscope`, [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), [MeshLab](https://www.meshlab.net/) or other. Otherwise, pick at random.\n",

Once the known degrees of freedom are collected (in a list or array), you can use [numpy.setdiff1d](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.setdiff1d.html) to get the unknowns. Using the index lists, you can extract submatrices of the lead sparse matrix via [slicing with scipy](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13352280/slicing-sparse-matrices-in-scipy-which-types-work-best)."
